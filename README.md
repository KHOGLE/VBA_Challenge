# VBA_Challenge
I actually included the sources of my codes in comments of my VBS script because I knew I needed to source everything and had not yet been aware that that was what we were putting in the readme. But oh well, have them again. 
My biggest For loop was created with the assistance of Marko Yang, a tutor.
Marko also was the one to point out which lastrow functions were right and we pulled from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21554059/how-to-get-the-row-count-in-excel-vba
A classmate provided the code to help the processing speed, which was wildly helpful for my old device, her name is Gina. I do not know where she got her code from, she just posted it in Slack. 
Shreha, an LA, helped me figure out the match functions. She pulled the code from https://www.educba.com/vba-match/
The rest of my code came from class.
